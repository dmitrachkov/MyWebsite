## My web-portfolio
_I made it with Angular 7_

Simple design with 3 main colors (_black, white and cornflower blue_) intended to present my artworks and my contact information.
For now it contain images I made with Cinema 4D and Maya + Arnold render. In a future I'd like to include more works, especially animation and expamples of my code.

I added [ngx-scrollbar](https://murhafsousli.github.io/ngx-scrollbar/) in my project
